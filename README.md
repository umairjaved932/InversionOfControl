# InversionOfControl

I recently worked in for a  new mobile app project and i used the dependency service to get the Version number in android and then use it anywhere in the project.

- An interface has been created to decouple the version number functionality. It can be used anywhere in the project with proper call.    
- This class will help out getting the PackageInfo of the Android and then we can use that information to return to interface. 
- We used the DependencyService to get the version number on any android device and save it in a variable.
